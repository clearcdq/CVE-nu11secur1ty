![](https://github.com/nu11secur1ty/CVE-nu11secur1ty/blob/main/vendors/unyasoft/CTMS/docs/Screenshot%202021-11-27%20121756-wall.png)

## [Vendor](https://www.sourcecodester.com/users/unyasoft)

## Description:
The parameters `username` and `contactno` from `COVID 19 Testing Management System (CTMS) 1.0` are vulnerable to Remote Code SQL injection attacks. 
Test REQUESTS:  Payloads 27325265' or 8079=8079-- and 35638130' or 9157=9162--.
These two requests resulted in different responses, indicating that the input is being incorporated into a SQL query in an unsafe way.
The attacker can execute a Remote Code Injection to override the current password for the admin account directly from the broadcast networks! 
Status Critical and awful.
