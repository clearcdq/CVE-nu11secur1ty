![](https://github.com/nu11secur1ty/CVE-nu11secur1ty/blob/main/vendors/Piwigo/2023/piwigo-13.6.0/docs/Screenshot%202023-05-01%20104807.png)

## Description:
The application is vulnerable to reflected DOM-based cross-site scripting.
The value of manual insertion point 2 is copied into a JavaScript string literal. The payload <kd1q0gb68f/a> was submitted in manual insertion point 2. The string containing the payload is then passed to jQuery.html. The malicious actor can craft a very malicious remote URL link and then he can send it to the already authenticated user to trick him to click on it and visit a very dangerous URL.

STATUS: HIGH Vulnerability
