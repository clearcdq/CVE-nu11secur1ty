## Description:
The WordPress Plugin Media and Media Library Folders 7.1.1 by Max Foundry suffers from Unauthenticated PDF Upload - RCE.
The attacker can upload a malicious PDF file without any sanitizing or problems, then he can just share the link with this malicious PDF.
After execution of this PDF, the user can destroy the system or it depends on the scenario. In this scenario, the infected user will just restart his OS when he clicks on the alias link, which link is starting an inside cmd command on his already infected computer because he is already an owner of this infected PDF. 

Status: CRITICAL

## CONCLUSION:
Example: Someone gives a malicious PDF to the administrator of some WordPress system, and tells him. Ey dude can you upload this important PDF with event information (for example) to the system and share the link with me because I need to share it with some friends who have an account on your system too, exactly like me (for example WordPress blog)?
Conclusion:
Every person who downloaded this vulnerable PDF from this WordPress system will infect his computer.
This is a super stupid architectural decision from the owner of this tool.
