[+] Description:
The Company's Recruitment Management System (by: oretnom23) in id=2 of the parameter from view_vacancy app on-page appears to be vulnerable to SQL Injection - Stealing the Password Hashes attacks. The payloads 19424269' or '1309'='1309 and 39476597' or '2917'='2923 were each submitted in the id parameter. These two requests resulted in different responses, indicating that the input is being incorporated into a SQL query in an unsafe way.

[+] Decrypt of the password
The password is based on PHP md5() function. So, MD5 reverse for 0192023a7bbd73250516f069df18b500 is admin123
