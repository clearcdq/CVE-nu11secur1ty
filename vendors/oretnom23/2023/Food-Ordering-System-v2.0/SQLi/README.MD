## SQLi

## Description:
The `email` parameter appears to be vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. 
A single quote was submitted in the email parameter, and a database error message was returned. 
Two single quotes were then submitted and the error message disappeared. 
The attacker can steal all information from the database of this system.
