### Description:
The MSMS-PHP (by: oretnom23 ) v1.0 in the application /mobile_store/classes/Login.php is vulnerable in thre sections!
1. remote SQL-Injection-Bypass-Authentication
- m0re info: https://portswigger.net/support/using-sql-injection-to-bypass-authentication. 
The parameter (username) from the login form is not protected correctly and there is no security and escaping from malicious payloads. 
When the user will sending a malicious query or malicious payload to the MySQL server he can bypass the login credentials and take control of the administer account.
2. XSS - Stored PHPSESSID Vulnerable
- The vulnerable XSS app: is "brand", parameters: "name" and "description"
After the successful SQL injection, the malicious user can be storing an XSS payload whit who can take the 
active PHPSESSID session.
3. remote PHPSESSID - Injection
- After the successful XSS attack the malicious user can take control of the administrative account of the system from everywhere 
by using the PHPSESSID, and then he can make a lot of bad things!


## Broken query:
```php
	public function login(){
		extract($_POST);

		$qry = $this->conn->query("SELECT * from users where username = '$username' and password = md5('$password') ");
		if($qry->num_rows > 0){
			foreach($qry->fetch_array() as $k => $v){
				if(!is_numeric($k) && $k != 'password'){
					$this->settings->set_userdata($k,$v);
				}

			}
```
## The fix, but not strong enough!
 
```php
	public function login(){
		extract($_POST);

		$qry = $this->conn->query("SELECT * from users where username = ('$username') and password = md5('$password') ");
		if($qry->num_rows > 0){
			foreach($qry->fetch_array() as $k => $v){
				if(!is_numeric($k) && $k != 'password'){
					$this->settings->set_userdata($k,$v);
				}

			}
```
