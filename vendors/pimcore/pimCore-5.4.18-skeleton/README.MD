## Description:
The pimCore-5.4.18-skeleton suffers from Sensitive Cookie with Improper SameSite Attribute vulnerability - PHPSESSID cookie Session management connection requests are not sanitizing correctly. 
There are no securing changes in PHPSESSID cookies for every request - validating sessions and changing a cookie for every connection - POST Request.
The attacker in the same network can trick the user - the administrator of this system and can steal his cookie, 
then he can make very evil things by using the same session from the name of the already authenticated user - administrator, on a couple of PCs with different IPs which are used from different machines into that network. 
When the attacker steals the cookie, he can manipulate the same session, for example, he can log out or do very malicious stuff.
This is a very stupid developer's error, and this can be very dangerous for the owner of the system. 
The attack is possible also in the external network!
