------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description:
The user_email parameter appears to be vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. A single quote was submitted in the user_email parameter, and a general error message was returned. Two single quotes were then submitted and the error message disappeared. You should review the contents of the error message, and the application's handling of other input, to confirm whether a vulnerability is present.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
### CONCLUSION: This vendor must STOP creating all these broken projects and vulnerable software programs, probably he is not a developer!
