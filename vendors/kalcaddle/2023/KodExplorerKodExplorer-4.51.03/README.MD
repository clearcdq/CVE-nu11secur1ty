## Description:
By using this vulnerability remotely, the malicious pwned_admin can list and manipulate all files inside the server. This is an absolutely DANGEROUS and STUPID decision from the application owner! In this scenario, the attacker prepares the machine for exploitation and sends a link for remote execution by using the CURL protocol to his supporter - another attacker. Then and he waits for execution from his colleague, to mask his action or even more worst than ever. What a nice hack is this! :)
