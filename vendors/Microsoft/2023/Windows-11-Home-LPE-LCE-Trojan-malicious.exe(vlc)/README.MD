## [Windows 11 Home LPE-LCE-Trojan-malicious.exe(vlc)](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-21775)

![](https://github.com/nu11secur1ty/CVE-nu11secur1ty/blob/main/vendors/Microsoft/2023/Windows-11-Home-LPE-LCE-Trojan-malicious.exe(vlc)/docs/Screenshot%202023-03-13%20142125.png)

## Description:
So. What actually is happening, is when we execute the `vlc.exe` file, we actually execute a Python script that opens our browser to a very malicious URL, and exe file at the same time which exe runs integrated software in Windows 11, which actually is the calculator app. This is actually the end of your system, it depends on the case. And in the end, the picture which we want to see, but this maybe will not be possible. If someone runs a malicious jpg like this, with an admin account, this probably will finish his OS. It depends on how malicious this `vlc.exe` is.
