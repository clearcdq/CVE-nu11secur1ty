## Vendor: Microsoft
## OS Name: Microsoft Windows 11 Home
## OS Version: 10.0.22000 N/A Build 22000

## Description:
So. What actually is happening, is when we execute the JPG file, execute the Python script which opens our browser to a very malicious URL,
and exe file at the same time which exe runs integrated software in Windows 11, which is the calculator. 
This is actually the end of your system, it depends on the case. And in the end, the picture which we want to see,
but this maybe will not be possible.
