![](https://github.com/nu11secur1ty/CVE-nu11secur1ty/blob/main/vendors/razormist/Attendance%20Management%20System/docs/Screenshot%202021-12-02%20145317.png)

## Description:
The value of the FirstRecord request parameter from Attendance Management System 1.0 system is copied into the value of an HTML tag attribute which is encapsulated in double quotation marks. 
The payload nu11secur1ty"><script>alert(1)</script>nu11secur1ty was submitted in the FirstRecord parameter. This input was echoed unmodified in the application's response.
This proof-of-concept attack demonstrates that it is possible to inject arbitrary JavaScript into the application's response. 
The Attacker can access the system, by using the XSS-reflected method, then he can store information by injecting the admin account on this system. 
Conclusion: The attacker can use this information every time when he wants, by executing a URL remote code injection!
STATUS: Critical and awful.
