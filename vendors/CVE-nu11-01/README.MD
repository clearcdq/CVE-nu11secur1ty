## 
The Simple Cafe Billing System is vulnerable in the application /cafe_billing/admin_class.php. 
The parameter (username) from the login form is not protected correctly and there is no security and escaping from malicious payloads. 
When the user is sending a request to the MySQL server he can bypass the login credentials and take control of the administer account.
