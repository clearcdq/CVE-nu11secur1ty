## 
The Simple Cafe Billing System is vulnerable in the application /cafe_billing/admin_class.php. 
The parameter (username) from the login form is not protected correctly and there is no security and escaping from malicious payloads. 
When the user is sending a request to the MySQL server he can bypass the login credentials and take control of the administer account.

## Broken structure:
```php
	function login(){
		extract($_POST);		
		$qry = $this->db->query("SELECT * FROM users where username = '".$username."' and password = '".md5($password)."' ");
		if($qry->num_rows > 0){
			foreach ($qry->fetch_array() as $key => $value) {
				if($key != 'passwors' && !is_numeric($key))
					$_SESSION['login_'.$key] = $value;
			}
				return 1;
		}else{
			return 3;
		}
	}
 ```
